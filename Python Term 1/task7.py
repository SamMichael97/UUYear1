#Practice Task 7
#Write a Python class to represent a book. The Book class should have attributes that reflect the common
#properties of a bookâ€“ title, author, publisher, page count and price, and provide a constructor method
#alongside appropriate getter and setter functions.
#Test your class with the following Python code that creates a Book object and displays certain details of the
#book:
#book_one = Book("1984", "George Orwell", "Penguin", 336, 6.99 )
#print(book_one.get_title())
#print(book_one.get_author())
#Sample Output
#1984
#George Orwell
#For the upcoming class test, you may assume that you will be asked to create a subclass from the Book class.
